# ReconSpider

ReconSpider is most Advanced Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Framework for scanning IP Address, Emails, Websites, Organizations and find out information from different sources.

ReconSpider can be used by Infosec Researchers, Penetration Testers, Bug Hunters and Cyber Crime Investigators to find deep information about their target.

ReconSpider aggregate all the raw data, visualize it on a dashboard and facilitate alerting and monitoring on the data.

Recon Spider also combines the capabilities of [Wave](https://github.com/adithyan-ak/WAVE),[Photon](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon) and [Recon Dog](https://github.com/s0md3v/ReconDog) to do a comprehensive enumeration of attack surface.

# Why it's called ReconSpider ?

```ReconSpider```  =  ```Recon```  +  ```Spider```


<b>Recon = Reconnaissance</b>

Reconnaissance is a mission to obtain information by various detection methods, about the activities and resources of an enemy or potential enemy, or geographic characteristics of a particular area.


<b>Spider = Web crawler</b>

A Web crawler, sometimes called a spider or spiderbot and often shortened to crawler, is an Internet bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web, typically for the purpose of Web indexing (web spidering).
